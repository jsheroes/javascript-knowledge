# Jest

Since it was lanched a few years back, Jest has become one of the most used JavaScript testing framework,  because its easy to use and setup ( Jest follows the #0CJS practices for Zero Configuration ). And has a lot of features already included in the framework, so is not need to add other plugins (but you can). But on the other side is flexible and you can use it in combination with other testing utilities.

Jest has included:
* assertions
* mocks
* spies
* stubs
* code coverage

Jest is often used to test React componets with [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
